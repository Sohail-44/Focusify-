A Productivity app based on the philosophy of Brian Tracy with a partner that allows users to input Goals, tasks, productive times for the day with priority and utilizes the data and provides a full schedule by sorting most important tasks in most productive times and vice versa to help users accomplish their most important goals for the day. So before going to bed, just spend some fun time with Focusify as it guides you to allocate goals and get a full schedule for the next day, knowing exactly what you want to accomplish next day.  This stems from Brian's core philosophy :" You don't have all the the time to do everything, but you always have time to do the most important things in life."
